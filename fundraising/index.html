											<h1>Monday</h1>
											<p>This week we are focusing on the why of our organization and sharing this purpose with others! Today’s focus is on our Children’s Miracle Network hospital, <strong>Shands Children’s Hospital</strong>, in Gainesville. Please feel free to use any of these tools as resources today to help in your fundraising!
											</p>
											<h2>Facebook Status Examples:</h2>
											
											<ul>
												<li><p>TODAY Dance Marathon at Florida State is For Shands #beCAUSE more than 7,000 children were treated at Shands Children’s Hospital last year and 50% of our fundraising is FOR THE KIDS. Help me reach my goal and donate so more miracles can happen this year!</p></li>
											
												<li><p>DID YOU KNOW 62 children enter a Children’s Miracle Network Hospital every minute? Luckily #beCAUSE of Shands Children’s Hospital in Gainesville these children can be treated by the top pediatric surgeons in not only the state but the NATION!! Today Dance Marathon at Florida State is #ForShands. Help me reach my goal and donate today!</p></li>
												
												<li><p>This past year, I was able to pay a visit to Shands Children’s Hospital in Gainesville after raising $100 for Dance Marathon at Florida State University. This experience was unforgettable as I was able to see, firsthand, how the funds we raise through Dance Marathon at FSU directly impact the children and families in need of intensive medical care. After my trip to Shands, I am now even more motivated to see more miracles happen at Dance Marathon where I pledge to stand for 20 hours for those who can’t! Please help us make more miracles for the families like the ones I was able to witness on my own trip!</p></li>
											</ul>

											<p>Hello ________!</p>
											<p>During my time at Florida State University, I have dedicated myself to supporting an organization called Dance Marathon. To give you a little background, Dance Marathon at Florida State University is the largest student-run philanthropy on our campus and, this year, I am looking forward to dancing in this year’s event. DM at FSU is a year-long effort that culminates into an annual 40-hour event, where more than 1,800 students stay awake and on their feet to raise money and awareness for our local beneficiaries. Over the past 20 years, DM at FSU has raised over $6 million for our local Children's Miracle Network Hospital, Shands Children's Hospital, and the FSU College of Medicine Pediatric Outreach Program. In 2015, DM at FSU raised a grand total of $1,100,645.52 For The Kids. These funds make the difference in providing the medical care, treatment, and research needed at our local Children's Miracle Network Hospital and the FSU College of Medicine!</p>
											<p>I am writing to you today asking for your support in our goal as we participate in our Week of Why. Today, February 8, 2016, Dance Marathon at Florida State University has set a goal to focus our fundraising on our beneficiary Shands Children’s Hospital, our Local Children’s Miracle Network Hospital. Each minute 62 children enter a Children’s Miracle Network Hospital and today you have the opportunity to impact their hospital experience. Every penny counts on our journey to make miracles for these children and families in need, and I would appreciate any support you are able to provide today- whether that be a personal donation or even just spreading the word about our goal for the day!</p>
											<p>If you would like to take part in this incredible movement today, the donation link can be found at:</p>
											<p>All donations are tax deductible and every little bit goes directly to making miracles for kids and families that are in need in the local Florida State community. Thank you so much for your time and if you would like more information on our cause and who we benefit, please check out our website at dmfsu.org.</p>

											<p>Hello ________!</p>
											
											<p>During my time at Florida State University, I have dedicated myself to supporting an organization called Dance Marathon. To give you a little background, Dance Marathon at Florida State University is the largest student-run philanthropy on our campus and, this year, I am looking forward to dancing in this year’s event. DM at FSU is a year-long effort that culminates into an annual 40-hour event, where more than 1,800 students stay awake and on their feet to raise money and awareness for our local beneficiaries. Over the past 20 years, DM at FSU has raised over $6 million for our local Children's Miracle Network Hospital, Shands Children's Hospital, and the FSU College of Medicine Pediatric Outreach Program. In 2015, DM at FSU raised a grand total of $1,100,645.52 For The Kids. These funds make the difference in providing the medical care, treatment, and research needed at our local Children's Miracle Network Hospital and the FSU College of Medicine!</p>
											<p>I am writing to you today asking for your support in our goal as we participate in our Week of Why. Today, February 10, 2016, Dance Marathon at Florida State University has set a goal to focus our fundraising on the tradition, legacy and impact our organization makes through the funds we have raised for the past 21 years. Every penny counts on our journey to make miracles for these children and families in need, and I would appreciate any support you are able to provide today- whether that be a personal donation or even just spreading the word about our goal for the day!</p>
											<p>If you would like to take part in this incredible movement today, the donation link can be found at: YOUR DONATION LINK HERE</p>
											<p>All donations are tax deductible and every little bit goes directly to making miracles for kids and families that are in need in the local Florida State community. Thank you so much for your time and if you would like more information on our cause and who we benefit, please check out our website at dmfsu.org.</p>
